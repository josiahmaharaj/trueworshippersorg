<h1>What we Believe in</h1>
	
<p>We Believe that there is one God, eternally existent in the Persons of the Holy Trinity as three eternal distinctions. Father, Son and Holy Ghost, Complete Unity in Trinity and Trinity in Unity, in one divine essence.  (1 Corinthians 8:6; 1 John 5:7)</p>

<p>We Believe in the Eternal, Immutable, Omniscient, Omnipotent, Omnipresent God, the Creator of the Universe. 	(Genesis 1:1)</p>

<p>We Believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, who before His incarnation, preexisted with God and was God. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and is Totally God and Totally man. 
						         (John 1:1,2,14)	</p>						

<p>We Believe in the virgin birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, His unqualified deity, His sinless humanity and perfect life, the eternal all—sufficiency of His atoning death, His bodily resurrection, His ascension to the Father’s right hand.(Jn. 20:20,25-29; Rom. 1 :4)</p>

<p>We Believe in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ who became the sin offering for us that we may receive the gift of salvation. 	(Matthew 28:6; 1 Corinthians 15:4-9)</p>

We Believe that Jesus ascended into heaven and is now seated at the right hand of the Father making intercession for us as our High Priest and Advocate while we await His imminent return.			(Acts 1:8-11; Hebrews 4:14-16) 

<p>We Believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus and the love of the Father all who receive Him, by faith, are born again of the Holy Spirit and shall have everlasting life.  (John 1:12-13 & 3:16;
	      Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5)</p>

<p>We Believe that His work is to convict, regenerate, seal and indwell everyone who accepts Jesus Christ as Saviour, imparting all spiritual gifts for the edification of the body. 	(Romans 8:9 & 12:6-8)</p>	

<p>We Believe that justification is a judicial act of God on the believer’s behalf solely on the merits of Christ, and that regeneration by the power of the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential for personal salvation.</p>
